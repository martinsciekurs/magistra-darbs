  title: Introduction
  description: GraphRAG is a Python-based data pipeline and knowledge-graph augmentation
    framework that indexes unstructured private text, extracts entities and relations,
    builds a hierarchical knowledge graph, and uses LLMs to answer questions with
    context-augmented prompts. This section provides an overview of the project, goals,
    and key concepts.

reasoning: The proposed TOC centers GraphRAG as a library with rich core capabilities
  (API, CLI, architecture) while giving clear, navigable access to its data model,
  AI orchestration, storage integrations, and end-to-end workflows. Core sections
  cover overview, quick start, and architecture, ensuring newcomers and power users
  can quickly orient themselves. Non-core sections provide reference material for
  APIs, CLI usage, data model semantics, provider integrations, storage/vector store
  bindings, and end-to-end workflows, with logical subsections to avoid overwhelming
  readers while enabling targeted deep dives.
