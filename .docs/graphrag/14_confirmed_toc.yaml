- description: GraphRAG is a Python-based data pipeline and knowledge-graph augmentation
    framework that indexes unstructured private text, extracts entities and relations,
    builds a hierarchical knowledge graph, and uses LLMs to answer questions with
    context-augmented prompts. This section provides an overview of the project, goals,
    and key concepts.
